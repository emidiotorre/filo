    <div id="text">Useful levels of detail for distinguishing meaningful graphic objects depend on the function of the graphic representation in its communicational context and on the goal of the compositional analysis. For example, for the schematic human figure depicted on a bathroom door, it will usually seem appropriate to regard it as an elementary graphic object. Likewise, for a symbol that depicts a knife and a fork, functioning to indicate a restaurant, it will usually seem appropriate to regard it as a single elementary graphic object. For the traffic sign indicating a bike path however - a white pictogram of a bicycle on a circular blue background, it is appropriate to regard it as a composite graphic object consisting of two elementary graphic objects - the pictogram off the bicycle, and the blue circular background. For a map it will usually seem appropriate to regard it as a composite graphic object consisting of many graphic sub-objects. For a complex graphic representation (e.g. a data- rich, multipanel computer visualization) it may be appropriate to decompose it at several levels, into nested, increasingly smaller graphic objects. For example, a legend of a map that is displayed as a box-shaped, superimposed inset, can be regarded both as a sub-object of the map, and also as a composite object, composed of various sub-objects itself. Figure 2-03 is such an example of a graphic representation in which graphic objects can be distinguished at several levels of detail.</div>
